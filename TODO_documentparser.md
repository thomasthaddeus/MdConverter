The `DocumentParser` class is designed to parse different elements of a Word document, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and images. However, the current implementation only supports parsing of headings, paragraphs, and tables. The methods for parsing lists and images are placeholders and do not perform any actions.

Here's what needs to be done in this class:

1. **Implement `parse_lists(self)` method:** The `python-docx` library does not support parsing of lists directly. You would need to implement custom logic to parse lists in the Word document. This might involve checking the style or format of each paragraph to determine if it's part of a list.

2. **Implement `parse_images(self)` method:** The `python-docx` library does not support parsing of images directly. You would need to implement custom logic to parse images in the Word document. This might involve extracting the images from the document, saving them as separate files, and storing references to these files.

3. **Error handling:** The current implementation does not provide any mechanism for handling errors. If an error occurs (e.g., the document is `None` or a paragraph does not have a style), the method will raise an exception and stop execution. You might want to add error handling code to catch these exceptions and handle them gracefully.

4. **Testing:** Once you've implemented these methods, you should write tests to ensure that they work as expected. This might involve creating test Word documents with different elements (headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and images) and checking if the `DocumentParser` class parses these elements correctly.

5. **Documentation:** The class and its methods are currently missing documentation. You should add docstrings to the class and each method to explain what they do, what arguments they take, what they return, and what exceptions they might raise. This will make the code easier to understand and maintain.
